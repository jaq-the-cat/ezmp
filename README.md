Easy music player for Android

## What it does

This app is very simple: it plays locally installed MP3 music in your device

You can make playlists, shuffle, close the app/block your phone without losing your
music, skip around the track, go forward/backward in the playlist, and play/pause.

It is currently in the development stage and does not have a planned release date,
though I doubt anyone cares.
